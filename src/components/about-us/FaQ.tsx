              Choosing the right mechanical switch depends on your typing style
              and preferences. KeyZone offers keyboards with various switch
              types, including linear, tactile, and clicky switches. Linear
              switches provide smooth keystrokes, tactile switches offer a bump
              at the actuation point, and clicky switches produce an audible
              click. Visit our Switch Guide for detailed information on each
              type to help you make an informed decision.
